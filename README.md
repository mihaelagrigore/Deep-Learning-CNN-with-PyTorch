# Convolutional Neural Networks with PyTorch

This repo contains one notebook, where I use PyTorch ML library to build a custom Convolutional Neural Network which I then use to classify the Fashion MNIST dataset.

<b>How to use it:</b>
Open the Jupyter Notebook in this folder. You can clone it, download it or just read it here. There is also a link at the top of the Notebook which takes you to the same Notebook on Kaggle.
